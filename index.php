                    MySQL/PHP
                    Many Web developers like
                    to build database-backed
                    Web sites using PHP
                    scripting in conjunction
                    with a MySQL database.
                    The MySQL/PHP
                    combination is ideally
                    suited to solving those
                    problems posed by Web
                    site designs that are not
                    scalable, maintainable,
                    or technically feasible
                    using conventional HTML
                    authoring techniques.
                    MySQL provides a fast,
                    reliable and easy-to-use
                    database solution that is
                    ideal for retrieving product
                    information and storing customer information. PHP is a server-side
                    HTML-embedded scripting language equivalent to Microsoft's Active
                    Server Pages on the Windows NT platform.
